Arduino and Sensors Class
=========================

This is the example code for my Arduino and Sensors class. It contains simple examples for all of the sensors in the [Adafruit Sensor Pack 900](http://www.adafruit.com/products/176). It also includes the datasheets for the accelerometer and the temperature sensor.

The PDF contains wiring diagrams and explanations for all of the sensors.
